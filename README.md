The implementation is divided into 2 main components: backend and frontend. 

Backend: is responsible for natural language processing and response generation. 
It uses advanced algorithms to interpret student queries and generate coherent and contextual responses. 
In addition, it has been integrated with an educational database and online resources to provide accurate and up-to-date information. 

Frontend: is the interface through which students interact with the chatbot. It is designed to be intuitive, 
easy to use and accessible through the web browser. As will be seen below, a Python library has been used to 
allow the configuration of the page to be adjusted without having to alter the main code too much.
